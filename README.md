#Bendy: Wavetable Automaton Synthesis with Indirect Feedback

Let's consider a cosmology in which all minds and everything we can perceive are very high-order emergent interactions between tiny elements. My work aims to engage this idea by constructing mathematical objects with complex dynamic behavior. Computers make it possible to simulate such objects and entangle them with the world of human sensory experience.

The present work is about a software synthesizer called Bendy. Bendy is a modest attempt work with sound within this paradigm; I hope it can create novel sound objects and enable musical experiences.
